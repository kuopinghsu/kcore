	  Enable console driver that writes to magic address 0xFFFFFFF4.
	  This is useful for simulation/testbench where characters written
	  to this address appear in the console output.
	  
	  This driver provides faster simulation performance compared to
	  the full UART driver, as it bypasses hardware FIFO and baud rate
	  timing simulation.
